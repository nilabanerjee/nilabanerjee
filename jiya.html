<p class = "heading"> Designs Created for CMU Jiya </p>
<p class ="regulartext"> Jiya is Carnegie Mellon University's premiere all-girls Bollywood fusion dance team. In addition to being captain, I also serve as the primary designer and maintain the official team website, which can be found <a href = "https://cmujiya.wordpress.com/"> here. </a> These are some of the materials I have created for Jiya. <br>
In designing the official logo, I attempted to incorpoate one of Pittsburgh's salient landmarks: the distinctive bridges that cross the three major rivers. I then reconciled this with the spirit of an Indian dance team with the addition of two dancing silhouettes.<br>
